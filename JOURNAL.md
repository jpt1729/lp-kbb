For transparency sake, I took some of the screen shots after the date because I realized it was a requirement so some stuff might get mixed up!

Been working on this for a little bit working on the schematic. One thing that happened the last time I designed this is I would delete random switches which would mess up the numbering so I am not doing that now!!!. 

I have designed out the PCB and the Schematic (only the keys so far) and have decided to go with a pico. 

Got pretty far but realized I was building an inverted keyboard which is exactly what I don't want. Fixed it and placed the LEDs

I've been working some more on the project. I made a couple of mistakes, but now they are fixed. The LEDs in the PCB are wired and so are the diodes. Working on connecting everything so that I can start adding the smaller bits and pieces to the PCB (art, screw holes, rounded corners, etc.). So far its looking really good. The LEDs are gunna be hard to solder but I should be good.

I got the keyboard basically all wired up I just need the columns and to wire up the ec11 and we gooooooddddd.

# 7/21/2025

Ok so now we are almost done! So I finished the PCB I decided to go with chamfered edges instead of rounded corners cause I feel like it will look cooler with the case. I want a case with a skeletal design.

Today, I finished wiring up everything putting the screws and all the stabalizers.

# 7/22/2025

Today I want to finish the project which means case design + firmware + art on pcb.

Starting with the Art on the PCB.

I finished the case I looks really nice and has the skeletal look I wanted

Writing the QMK firmware!

**Hours spent: 2 hrs**

# 7/27/2025

Getting everything written out to be approved. BOM stuff and finding parts. taking screen shots. making sure everything is perfect!!!

**Hours spent: 2 hrs**

## Revisions!

# 8/4/2025

Redesigned the case. Had to do it from scratch and add some "complexity" which for me was including walls that are skeletal (I don't want a top cause why did I add pcb art js to cover it??)

**Hours spent: 4 hrs**

# 8/5/2025

Quick fixes to BOM README.md journal and taking photos and stuff

**Hours spent: 1 hr**
