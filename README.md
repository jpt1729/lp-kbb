# Low-profile Keyboard

This is a low profile 65% keyboard with a rotary encoder (for volume + mute/unmute). This project uses Gateron's ks33 switches and their respective hotswap sockets. This is all on top of a skeletal 3d printed case. (also texas themed)

I made this project because 1 I just want a custom keyboard and 2 the keyboard I want kinda doesn't exist. I don't haven't really seen these keyboard with the skeletal cases or chamfered edges so I kinda wanted to make it + its texas themed :).
